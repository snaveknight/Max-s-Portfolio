Hello! My name is Max Evans and this is my portfolio of a few of the projects I've done working at EJ as well as 
some projects from when I was enrolled at Tech Elevator programming bootcamp in Detroit Michigan. 

I have been doing full stack development for the last two years but my specific stack has been Java, javascript, html, css and sql. And for this portfolio I wanted to build it with react to get some react experience.
